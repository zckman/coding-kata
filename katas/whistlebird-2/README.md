The prototype was a success; investors showered the CEO of "TechGenius Solutions" with money. But disillusionment soon set in when the first bill for operating the backend arrived.

### Given
* Connection String: "*postgresql://whistlebird:Whistlebird1337@postgres:5432/postgres*"

### Requirements
* API can be called by "*localhost:XXXX*"
* When the API container starts the server starts too
